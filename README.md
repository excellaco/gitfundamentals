# GIT Fundamentals

**What is Git?**
Git is a widely-used distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It helps track changes to files, manage project history, and collaborate efficiently on code. Git is particularly popular in software development due to its flexibility and powerful branching capabilities, but it is also valuable in other fields that involve file management and collaboration.

**Key Features of Git:**
**Version Control**: Tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if necessary. \
**Branching and Merging**: Enables multiple people to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, merging changes when ready.\
**Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration between team members, making it easy to share and review code.\
**History Tracking**: Maintains a history of changes, providing insight into what was changed, who changed it, and why.

## GIT Use Cases 
1. Adding a New Feature (Chapter in our case)
2. Fixing a Bug (Fixing a typo in one of the chapters)
3. Live - Adding some new lines to an existing Feature that was also updated by someone else (merge conflicts)
