# GIT Fundamentals

**What is Git?**
Git is a widely-used distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It helps track changes to files, manage project history, and collaborate efficiently on code. Git is particularly popular in software development due to its flexibility and powerful branching capabilities, but it is also valuable in other fields that involve file management and collaboration.

**Key Features of Git:**

**Version Control**: Tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if necessary. \
**Branching and Merging**: Enables multiple people to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, merging changes when ready.\
**Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration between team members, making it easy to share and review code.\
**History Tracking**: Maintains a history of changes, providing insight into what was changed, who changed it, and why.

**Data Analysis Use Cases:**
   1. Version control for analysis scripts - provides clear record of change as scripts are updated
   2. Collaboration on analysis projects - multiple analysts can contribute to a shared repo
   3. Documentation and Reproducibility - using the README and having well commented code
   4. Jupyter Notebooks version control 
   5. Automated Reporting and Dashboards

**Data Engineer Use Cases:**
   1. Version Control for Data pipelines
   2. Infrastructure as Code management - Terraform
   3. Collaboration on DE projects
   4. Managing Data Schema changes
   5. Deployment automation with CI/CD Pipelines
   6. Backups and disaster recovery - ensuring that pipelines can be restored quickly in the event of a failure
